// Write a code which can give grades to students according to theirs scores:
// 80-100, A
// 70-89, B

// Check if the season is Autumn, Winter, Spring or Summer. If the user input is :
// September, October or November, the season is Autumn.
// December, January or February, the season is Winter.
// March, April or May, the season is Spring
// June, July or August, the season is Summer

// Check if a day is weekend day or a working day. Your script will take day as an input.

// let today = new Date();
// let day = today.getDay();

// if( day >= 1 && day <= 5 ){
